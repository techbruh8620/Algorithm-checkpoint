# Find the sum of all distinct elements from two given sets of array.

### This algorithm returns the sum of distinct elements in two given arrays


- The algorithm takes an array of set1 and set2
- A variable of array for the distinct elements between the two sets of array
- It also takes a variable of counter for the total of the distinct elements which is distinct_sum 
- A nexted iterative approach is adopted to loop over the sets of array and the distinct array to get the distinct sum
